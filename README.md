### Welcome to my GitHub Profile 👋

Hello! I'm Théo, a (mostly backend) software developer from Brazil. 🇧🇷
I'm usually working on college projects since I'm trying to finish my Computer Science degree, but you can spot some recent projects here and there that are not related to college activities. I like to try a bit of ✨everything✨.

Even though I work mostly on the backend 🧮, I like thinking about interface design and frontend development 🖥️, you can catch some of my _frontend projects_ and tests on my 🔗[CodePen](https://codepen.io/lightthe) profile.  
I'm trying to learn how to better use architecture and design patterns to build solid web apps and microservices that don't suck all that much (the whole "be an engineer, not just a coder" thing). But this is a somewhat of a _long term_ investment. Today I'm mostly focused on 🌱 learning better **React** and 👀 getting to know **Quarkus**.

- 💬 Ask me about: **Kendo** (the martial art); Microsoft's old **Metro Design**; the **Playstation 3** and **Coffee** ☕
- 📫 How to reach me: There's an e-mail address on the sidebar right there 👈. It's active and I (sometimes) read it.

Catch the pinned repositories below to get started on the projects I think are cooler.  
<sup>Somos todos devs cansados</sup>

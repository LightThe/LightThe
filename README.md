### Welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm ThÃ©o, a (mostly backend) software developer from Brazil. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
I'm usually working on college projects since I'm trying to finish my Computer Science degree, but you can spot some recent projects here and there that are not related to college activities. I like to try a bit of everything.

Even though I work mostly on the backend, I like thinking about interface design and frontend development, you can catch some of my frontend projects and tests on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/lightthe) profile.
I'm trying to learn how to better use architecture and design patterns to build solid web apps and microservices that don't suck all that much (the whole "be an engineer, not just a coder" thing). But this is a somewhat of a _long term_ investment. Today I'm focused on learning better React and getting to know Quarkus.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: **Kendo** (the martial art); Microsoft's old **Metro Design**; The **Playstation 3**; **Coffee** â˜•
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: There's an e-mail on the sidebar right there ðŸ‘ˆ It's active and I (sometimes) read it.

Catch the pinned repositories below to get started on the projects I think are cooler.
